/********************************************************************

 The tree module implements a binary tree. This is used by the Huffman coding
 algorithm to represent a tree of characters where each character is found in
 a leaf.  We use the path to the character to represent the binary encoding of
 each character.  The goal is to have short paths for the characters that are
 mosts frequently encountered in the input text.
