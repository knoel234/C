// The `run_bank` function runs the "bank" which will wait for
// commands from ATM processes. It can only be called after a call to
// `bank_open` is called. This function has the following parameters:
//
// bank_in_fd - The input file descriptor on which the bank will
//              receive commands
// atm_out_fd - A table of file descriptors to which the bank can
//              send commands.  Each file descriptor corresponds
//              to a different ATM.  This must have atm_cnt elements.
//
// This function will return a status code indicating success or
// failure. The list of error codes can be found in errors.h.
