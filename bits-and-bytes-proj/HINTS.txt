Woohoo Hints!

Here are few things you should keep in mind as you do this assignment:

* Make sure you type in *everything* exactly as requested.
* Pay careful attention to newlines in your printf statements.
* Make sure you are clear about ascii codes.
* Write out the bitwise operations on paper so you understand exactly
  what you are doing. Do not be afraid to write some test programs
  that aid in your understanding of the bitwise operators such as
  <<, >>, |, and &.
* Use the hints provided by the test programs to help you in arriving
  at the solutions.
* Make sure you use the correct C data types when requested. Remember,
  in C you can have both *signed* and *unsigned* types - understand
  exactly what the difference is.

Good luck and have fun!
